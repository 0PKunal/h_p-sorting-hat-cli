## Overview

Welcome to the **Sorting Hat** project! This repository contains implementations of sorting algorithms in both C and Python. The project is designed to help users understand and compare sorting algorithms across different programming languages.

## Files

- **`sorting_hat.c`**: A C implementation of sorting algorithms.
- **`sorting_hat.py`**: A Python implementation of sorting algorithms.
- **`LICENSE`**: The license file for this project.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

## Features

- Compare sorting algorithms in C and Python.
- Learn how sorting algorithms are implemented in different languages.
- Experiment with and modify the code to suit your needs.
- Well-documented code for easy understanding.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## Prerequisites

### For C:
- GCC compiler (e.g., MinGW on Windows).
- A terminal or command prompt.

### For Python:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A terminal or command prompt.

## How to Use

### Running the C Program
1. Open the project folder in your terminal.
2. Build the C program using the provided build task:
   ```bash
   gcc sorting_hat.c -o sorting_hat.exe
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable:
   ```bash
   ./sorting_hat.exe
   ```
   > **Note:** On Windows, you may need to use `sorting_hat.exe` instead of `./sorting_hat.exe`.

### Running the Python Program
1. Open the project folder in your terminal.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python sorting_hat.py
   ```

## Tasks

This project includes the following tasks for Visual Studio Code:

- **Build C Program**: Compiles the `sorting_hat.c` file into an executable.
- **Run C Program**: Runs the compiled C program.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated! Here are some ways you can contribute:

### Suggest Enhancements
- Propose new features or improvements.
- Optimize performance or add additional functionality.

### Submit Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Make your changes with clear, commented code.
4. Test thoroughly with different inputs.
5. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

### Ideas for Contribution
- Add more robust input validation and error handling.
- Implement unit tests for the Python script.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the sorting algorithms.
- Add support for additional languages or platforms.
- Enhance the performance of existing algorithms.

Please ensure any code contributions maintain the existing style and include appropriate documentation.
